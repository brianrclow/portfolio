## Tech Stack

* Frontend: Angular, Tailwind CSS
* Icons: Font Awesome

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js and npm installed
* Angular CLI installed globally (npm install -g @angular/cli)

### Install and Run

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/brianrclow/portfolio.git
cd portfolio-website
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```sh
ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
